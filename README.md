# Cyber Resources
-> by Mercury180


This is a collection of all the best resources I've learnt from and used in the past year of my cyber security learning. 

This is in no means a complete list, and will be updated consistently when I come across new content, or simply remember platforms I used to use. 

I'll try and sort this collection of resources into a few key sections:
- Linux
- Windows
- Cryptography
- Web 
- Binary
- General Hacking
- Miscellaneous


## Linux
**https://linuxjourney.com/** - So much incredible content on Linux, gets into the nitty gritty about processes etc.

**https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals** - Good for getting to grips with the command line

I think a great way of getting to grips with Linux is by trying to exploit it. Learning Linux privilege escalation is a good way to practice and deepen your understanding. Boot2Root machines are great for this, but I'd recommend start with **https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxprivesc** (TryHackMe again) to learn some of the more common PrivEsc methods before throwing yourself at a machine. 



## Windows

**https://youtu.be/Sdz1IOQghgo** - John Strand's introduction to Windows command line.

### Powershell
**https://posh-hunter.com/** - CTF-like introduction to Powershell.
**https://underthewire.tech/** - OverTheWire, but for Powershell.


## Cryptography
**https://cryptohack.org/** - The *best* platform I've come across for cryptography so far.

**https://www.crypto101.io/** - A great book, if you pair this with the platform above, it will give you a great overall understanding.

**https://www.cipherchallenge.org/resources-media/** - This one comes from the Cipher Challenge, run by the University of Southampton, it has multiple slides introducing some basic concepts, and a 60-page long handbook.

**https://cryptopals.com** - I can't explain it better than they can, definitely worth checking the site out.

**"An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography 2014"** - Note: this is ***not*** free, and quite the opposite. However, I was lucky enough to get an old copy off a friend, and there's no way I can leave this one out. The content is great, so if you want to pursue cryptography further, this book is a good place to start. 



## Binary
**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/** - A course on Binary Exploitation based around CTF challenges. 

**https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/** - Notes from a student, definitely worth checking out!


## Web
**https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-materials** - How could I make a resource list and leave portswigger out, the web academy is simply the best I've seen for people wanting to learn more on Web Exploitation.

**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jk_I-cw4WE&list=PLI_rLWXMqpSl_TqX9bbisW-d7tDqcVvOJ** - PwnFunction has a great collection of very clear videos explaining some web exploitation techniques, if you find videos easier to digest.

**https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuyTk2_mYISLaZC4fVqDuW_hOk0dd5rlf** - Rana Khalil is amazing at explaining in depth SQL injection, and she's regularly producing more content, so watch this space!
