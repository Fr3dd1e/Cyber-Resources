# Cyber Resources
-> by Mercury180


This is a collection of all the best resources I've learnt from and used in the past year of my cyber security learning. 

This is in no means a complete list, and will be updated consistently when I come across new content, or simply remember platforms I used to use. 

I'll try and sort this collection of resources into a few key sections:
- Linux
- Windows
- Cryptography
- Web 
- Binary
- Miscellaneous


## Linux


## Windows


## Cryptography
**https://cryptohack.org/** - The *best* platform I've come across for cryptography so far.

**https://www.crypto101.io/** - A great book, if you pair this with the platform above, it will give you a great overall understanding

**https://www.cipherchallenge.org/resources-media/** - This one comes from the Cipher Challenge, run by the University of Southampton, it has multiple slides introducing some basic concepts, and a 60-page long handbook.

**"An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography 2014"** - Note this is ***not*** free, and quite the opposite. However, I was lucky enough to get an old copy off a friend, and there's no way I can leave this one out. The content is great, so if you want to pursue cryptography further, this book is a good place to start.
