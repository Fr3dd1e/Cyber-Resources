# Cyber Resources
-> by Mercury180


This is a collection of all the best resources I've learnt from and used in the past year of my cyber security learning. 

This is in no means a complete list, and will be updated consistently when I come across new content, or simply remember platforms I used to use. 

I'll try and sort this collection of resources into a few key sections:
- Linux
- Windows
- Cryptography
- Web 
- Binary
- General Hacking
- Miscellaneous


## Linux
**https://linuxjourney.com/** - So much incredible content on Linux, gets into the nitty gritty about processes etc.

**https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals** - Good for getting to grips with the command line

I think a great way of getting to grips with Linux is by trying to exploit it. Learning Linux privilege escalation is a good way to practice and deepen your understanding. Boot2Root machines are great for this, but I'd recommend start with https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxprivesc (TryHackMe again) to learn some of the more common PrivEsc methods before throwing yourself at a machine. 



## Windows


## Cryptography
**https://cryptohack.org/** - The *best* platform I've come across for cryptography so far.

**https://www.crypto101.io/** - A great book, if you pair this with the platform above, it will give you a great overall understanding

**https://www.cipherchallenge.org/resources-media/** - This one comes from the Cipher Challenge, run by the University of Southampton, it has multiple slides introducing some basic concepts, and a 60-page long handbook.

**https://cryptopals.com** - I can't explain it better than they can, definitely worth checking the site out.

**"An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography 2014"** - Note this is ***not*** free, and quite the opposite. However, I was lucky enough to get an old copy off a friend, and there's no way I can leave this one out. The content is great, so if you want to pursue cryptography further, this book is a good place to start.
